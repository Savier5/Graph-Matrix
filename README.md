# Graph/Matrix

This Java program was developed as part of a Discrete Structures assignment focused on graph theory concepts. It features a hardcoded 4x4 adjacency matrix representing a directed graph with vertices labeled A through D. The program first prints the matrix in a readable format, labeling rows and columns with the appropriate vertex names.

It then demonstrates six fundamental graph traversal types (Walk, Trail, Path, Closed Walk, Circuit, and Cycle) by outputting valid examples for each based on the graph structure. Each example is displayed as a sequence of vertex labels connected by arrows, making it easy to visualize the type of traversal.

This project reinforces key graph theory ideas and shows how adjacency matrices can be used in programming to analyze and represent different types of connections within a graph.
